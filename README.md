# CosmosDB PCF
# Description
This control has been created to retrieve data from any cosmodb environment and show the returned JSON. This will make a request to the selected CosmosDB environment (based on a query), parse the Json retured and paste it in a JsonPrettifier React Control. This control will be helpful if you do not have a sync data between D365 and CosmosDB. This will not syn your data between both environment, only retrieve data and show it.
